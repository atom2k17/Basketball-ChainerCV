# Basketball-ChainerCV
This is a two class object detection and recognition project. The two classes are ball and player. The project is done using ChainerCV which is a framework based on chainer, used for Computer Vision.
# Dataset
The dataset used here is made from scratch. Here I used 400 images downloaded from Google. Each image were resized to 320*240.
It also includes annotation files for each of the 400 images. The annotation files were generated by an application called LabelImg which annotates images and generates xml files. The xml files contain the co-ordinates of each object of each class in the particular image.
Three text files train, val and test were created which contains the list of images assigned for training, validation and testing respectively.

Validation accuracy of 66% was achieved after 300 epochs of training. Accuracy can be improved by increasing the training and validation dataset, and increasing the number of training epochs.
